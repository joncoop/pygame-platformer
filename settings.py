"""
Global configuration and assets for the game.

This module centralizes constants, file paths, and default values used throughout
the game. It includes:

- Window settings (screen size, grid size, FPS, camera lag)
- Colors and fonts
- File paths for images, sounds, and music
- Level configuration and starting level
- Default character attributes and physics
- Gameplay controls mapping
- Item and enemy properties

No game logic is implemented here; this module is strictly for configuration.
